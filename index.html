          <h2>Hi, I'm Jessica!</h2>
          <p>I am a senior at Ohio State’s Fisher College of Business, pursuing a B.S. in Business Administration with a focus on Information Systems. I’m passionate about data analytics, UX design, and the Generative AI field, and I love exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. 
          <p>I thrive on trying new things and tackling challenges, and I consider myself a creative thinker who enjoys thinking outside the box. I’m always looking for opportunities to excel, learn, and contribute to projects and teams that push boundaries and make an impact.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>CSE 3231 – Database Design Project (Team of 4) AU25</p> 
    <p></p>
    <p>Collaborated in a team of four to develop a comprehensive database system for a mock warehouse company. The project began with designing an ER diagram to model business entities and their relationships, which was then translated into a relational database. We analyzed functional dependencies to ensure the schema was normalized to 3NF/BCNF, guaranteeing data integrity and reducing redundancy.
    </p>
    <p>Using SQLite Studio, we populated the database with sample data and implemented indexes to optimize query performance. To make the database accessible to users, we constructed a Java-based UI connected via JDBC, allowing users to add, modify, delete, and query data efficiently. We also developed transactions to simulate realistic customer interactions and maintain consistency.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, we designed and executed a variety of SQL queries to validate functionality, test performance, and ensure the database accurately supported the intended business operations.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>So let's talk about who I am...</p>
    <p>I’m originally from Southgate, Michigan. I grew up with a normal childhood in cookie cutter town, but I grew up with a big personality and and natural talent to do more with my life. Even as a teenager, I was drawn to leadership roles, my first “job” wasn’t even real work. It sounds silly, but at 14, I became a Server Moderator on a Minecraft server with over 1,000 players around the world. I patrolled the server itself, forums, and Discord to keep it family-friendly and running smoothly. I handled ticket requests, managed operations, and learned the thrill of responsibility. No paycheck required, I just loved the challenge.
    <p>By 16, it was time for a “real” job, so I joined Tropical Smoothie Cafe, where I spent two years learning teamwork, customer service, and how to keep operations flowing in a fast-paced environment. Those early experiences shaped how I approach challenges today: dive in, take responsibility, and learn from the process.
    <p>Then came college, and a very big leap. Out of the four schools I applied to, I chose The Ohio State University, far from home, because I didn’t want the predictable choice. Life had always been structured for me, and for the first time, I didn’t know what to expect. It was scary, it was challenging, it was the unknown and yes, I even considered transferring back. But I stuck it out, switched my major, and learned to embrace uncertainty, lessons that would later prepare me for my internship at Trane Technologies in North Carolina, where I took another leap, but this time it was easier. I spent three months growing both professionally and personally alongside a team of talented and welcoming individuals, which adequately prepared me to start my next chapter in life, post grad.
    <p>Now, as a senior at Fisher College of Business, I often reflect on the journey I had taken, and I can say that this is just the beginning of my story, one where curiosity, creativity, and a little bit of fearlessness guide every step.
